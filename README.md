## Introduce
The project provides staking functionality for Fair token holders through Tron smart contracts, providing security and trust for various online transactions through staking. Mainly contains the following functions: 
* Pledge contract: Fair token holders initiate pledge contracts, obtain credit by locking tokens for a long time, become an ecological participant, and join the FAIR DAO ecological construction. 
* Dispute Contract: When consumers of Fair tokens encounter unfair treatment, they can raise disputes and request to divide the tokens pledged by the corresponding ecological participants, and use a fair vote of Fair DAO to finally make a ruling. 
* Unsecured contract: Ecological participants can unsecured some or all of the tokens and exit ecological construction.
